My research interest focuses on unraveling the molecular sociology between cellular membranes, organelles, and the proteins that shape and transport them. Specifically, I investigate how the internal architecture of neurons shifts in response to normal physiological conditions and pathological states. <br>
<br>
I am currently a Lenfant Postdoctoral Fellow (F32 equivalent) in the laboratory of Structural Cell Biology at the National Institutes of Health led by [Naoko Mizuno](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/laboratory-structural-cell-biology) where I use cryo-electron tomography and fluorescence live-imaging to gain a comprehensive ultrastructural and dynamic view of neuronal membrane processes.  
<br>
I received my Ph.D. in molecular & cell biology from [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), supported by a Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Fellowship (F31), under the mentorship of [James Hurley](https://membrane.berkeley.edu/) and [Carlos Bustamante](https://bustamante.berkeley.edu/). During my graduate training, I built and used optical force microscopy coupled with fluorescence to study membrane scission mechanisms employed by a subset of ESCRT proteins <i>in vitro</i>.

<br>
In a previous life, I was a marine biogeochemist studying the role of anoxic marine sediments in organic matter in the lab of [Tomoko Komada](https://komadatmk.wixsite.com/komadalab) at [San Francisco State University](https://www.sfsu.edu/), where I also received my undergraduate degree in chemistry. Additionally, I developed methods to study reactive oxygen species involved in heme protein biochemistry for my masters in chemistry research in the lab of Raymond Esquerra. I am also a proud alumnnus of [City College of San Francisco](https://www.ccsf.edu/).

I am a first-generation immigrant from the Philippines and spent my early teen and adult life in the Bay Area of California. I currently live in the DMV and trying to figure out what to do when it snows.
