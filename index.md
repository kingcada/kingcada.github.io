I am interested in understanding the molecular sociology of cellular membranes and organelles with the proteins that shape and transport them. I am currently a Lenfant Postdoctoral Fellow (F32 equivalent) in the laboratory of Structural Cell Biology led by Naoko Mizuno where I use cryo-electron tomography and fluorescence live-imaging to study neuronal membrane processes.

I earned my Ph.D. in molecular & cell biology from UC Berkeley as a Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Fellow (F31) funded by NIAID, under the mentorship of James Hurley and Carlos Bustamante. During my graduate training I built and used optical force microscopy coupled with fluorescence to understand membrane deformation caused by ESCRT binding in vitro. In a previous life, I was a marine biogeochemist studying the role of anoxic marine sediments in organic matter in the lab of Tomoko Komada at San Francisco State University where I also received my undergraduate degree in chemistry. I also developed methods to study reactive oxygen species in heme protein biochemistry during for my masters in chemistry in the lab of Raymond Esquerra.
